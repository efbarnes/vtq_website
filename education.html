					<h2> Undergraduate QISE Minor Program </h2> 
					In 2022, VTQ established a new minor degree in QISE. This degree, which is among the first of its kind in the United States, brings together 7 departments and degree programs from the Colleges of Science and Engineering, including Chemistry, Computational Modeling and Data Analytics, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Materials Science, Mathematics, and Physics. It was created in response to a rapidly growing need to strengthen the QISE workforce, as has been recognized in bills recently put forward in the US Congress, including the National Quantum Initiative Act (passed into law Dec. 2018), the Quantum Network Infrastructure and Workforce Development Act (introduced April 2021), and the Quantum for Universal Advancement in Nationwide Technology Use and Modernization (QUANTUM) for National Security Act (introduced in April 2021). Students partaking in the minor take four mandatory courses that introduce the background knowledge and basic skills required of all QISE researchers. In addition, they choose from among a small set of upper-level courses. All remaining courses can be taken within the students’ home departments, facilitating compatibility with their majors and allowing them to specialize in various aspects of QISE, which is currently one of the most interdisciplinary fields in science and engineering.

					<b> Core Courses: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Hello Quantum World!</b> (PHYS 2254): 
							<p> 
							A freshman and sophomore undergraduate course that provides students with a first introduction to QISE. This is done using a rigorous pictorial framework that allows students to grasp the central concepts and perform real calculations without the need for advanced mathematics such as linear algebra, which is normally a prerequisite for courses on quantum mechanics. Hello Quantum World! takes an application-first approach to introducing QISE that can help motivate students to take advanced courses in linear algebra, quantum mechanics, and QISE in later years. In addition to homeworks, students work through longer-term projects in teams. For example, one project is to figure out how quantum teleportation works, while another is to discover Grover’s algorithm (disguised as a puzzle called Money or Tigers) step by step. More details about the course can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02868
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b> Quantum Software I&II </b> (CHEM/PHYS 3684/4684)
						</li>
						<li>
							<b> Quantum Information Technologies </b>  (PHYS 4264)
						</li>
						<li>
							<b> Quantum Optics and Qubit Processors </b>  (PHYS 4264/5264):
							<p>
							A course that introduces students to the hardware used in quantum information technologies. After covering the key requirements that any quantum system must satisfy in order to be useful for QISE applications, the course surveys various leading hardware platforms, comparing their relative merits and drawbacks and summarizing recent progress in the field. Throughout the course, students work in teams on a project of their choice. They present their work at the end of the semester in two formats: a written report and an oral presentation delivered to the class. These activities are designed to build important but often less-emphasized research skills, including collaboration, scientific writing, understanding scientific literature, and delivering scientific presentations.
