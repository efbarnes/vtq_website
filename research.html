						While the simulation of quantum systems on today's classical computers has been tremendously successful, large, strongly correlated quantum systems remain challenging even for the world's best supercomputers. This is due to the inability of classical machines to efficiently store or manipulate exponentially large quantum states. The concept of digital quantum simulation proposes to circumvent this problem by replacing or supplementing the classical computer with a programmable quantum processor built from qubits. Quantum simulation is believed to be one of the most near-term applications of quantum information science in that a modest-sized quantum processor containing as few as 50-100 qubits may be sufficient to simulate systems that are classically intractable. Realizing this potential requires simultaneous advancements in qubit hardware and in simulation algorithms. Our research focuses on developing new, efficient algorithms for quantum simulation that reduce the resources needed to extract the desired information from the system being simulated such as energy eigenvalues and eigenstates. We also work closely with experimental groups to determine the control schemes and device architectures that are optimal for achieving efficient, accurate simulations.

						Future powerful quantum computers will be capable of running algorithms that can be used to crack the RSA encryption system---the predominant scheme used to protect sensitive data and internet transactions across the world. Although quantum mechanics can be used to compromise information security in this way, it also offers a way to defend against such attacks. The quantum no-cloning theorem, which forbids the copying of unknown quantum states, implies that it is possible to transmit information in a way that makes it impossible to intercept transmissions without being detected. This idea has lead to the notion of quantum communication, which aims to develop communication networks that are immune to hacking, even by large-scale quantum computers. While the no-cloning theorem is the basic principle that makes quantum communication possible, it also poses a challenge. Transmitting information over long distances generally requires that the information be copied and re-amplified at multiple points (repeaters) along the information path due to the lossiness of optical fibers. However, the no-cloning theorem prevents a direct implementation of this idea in the case of quantum information. Quantum entanglement can be used to get around this problem. We are developing schemes to produce complex, entangled states of light for long-distance quantum communication networks. This effort is based on our recent theoretical finding that the complex states needed for distributing information securely across networks can be produced using only a few quantum emitters. We are working with our experimental collaborators to construct and test photonic circuit devices capable of implementing our idea.

						Harnessing the power of quantum mechanics and integrating it into new technologies is a long-standing goal in the fields of quantum information and nanoscience. The main obstacle to realizing such quantum technologies is decoherence. In addition to making advancements in the design and fabrication of nanoscale systems, overcoming this problem requires the development of control protocols capable of maintaining or manipulating the quantum information stored in these systems while simultaneously mitigating the deleterious effects of the environment. We use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to design quantum control schemes that suppress noise errors and unwanted interactions while implementing quantum operations. We design such techniques primarily for solid-state qubits, including superconducting qubits and spin qubits, in close collaboration with experimental groups. Our analytical approaches include the exploitation of a close relationship between quantum evolution and the differential geometry of space curves.

						<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic15.jpg" alt="" /></span> <h2>Quantum error correction</h2>
						While near-term quantum systems may prove technologically useful, fault-tolerant quantum computers with built-in quantum error correction (QEC) schemes have a far broader range of potential applications relevant to both industry and national security (e.g., communication encryption, materials simulation, sensing, logistics optimizations, and more applications still yet to be discovered). This is because, as in classical computation, logical gate operations on quantum devices are prone to errors that accumulate exponentially in the absence of QEC, limiting the scale of computations that can be done accurately. Only in the regime of fault-tolerance, where QEC is implemented at a rate that outpaces the buildup of errors, can information survive indefinitely, and arbitrary computations can, in principle, be performed. Unfortunately, QEC codes are significantly more challenging to construct compared to classical codes. This complication is multi-fold. Unlike classical information, quantum information cannot be replicated, ruling out simple schemes based on redundancy. In addition, quantum measurements, which are needed to detect errors, also alter the state they intend to probe. Further complicating the issue, quantum information is susceptible to novel errors that are not present in any classical system. Moreover, simulating dynamic quantum systems is challenging, making it difficult to test ideas. The inherent complexity of QEC codes, together with the realities of near-term devices (short coherence times, low-fidelity and slow gate operations, measurement errors, etc.), make realizing practical QEC one of the grand challenges in the field. Despite these challenges, significant progress has been made over the past three decades, and VTQ members are working hard to leverage these to make QEC a practical reality.

                        In addition to being a uniquely quantum concept that has no classical analog, quantum entanglement is also a fundamental resource for most quantum information technologies. Large-scale many-body (or multi-qubit) entanglement is especially important for quantum network applications, measurement-based quantum computing, and quantum error correction. This is why it is important to understand how many-body entanglement can be created and how it evolves over time. It is also important to understand how entanglement is affected by measurements and other factors that arise in quantum computation. In addition to serving as a QISE resource, entanglement can also be used to characterize and distinguish different types of dynamical many-body systems. Thus, questions related to the growth and spread of entanglement naturally lie at the interface of QISE and quantum condensed matter physics. VTQ researchers are working to shed light on these issues with the aim of both improving our fundamental understanding of entanglement and of learning how to best leverage it for practical applications.
